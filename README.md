# Program-1
 LSU CSC 4103 Operating Systems Program 1. Implement a multi-threaded sudoku solution validator.

 Requires POSIX threads library to compile.

 Accepts a single command line argument, the path of a txt file containing a sudoku solution to be validated. This file should be of the format 

 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 X X X X X X X X X<br>
 Where each X is a number.

 The program will output each time a thread checks a row, column, or subgrid and indicate its validity. The program will also output a final message indicating whether  the solution is valid or not.

 There is a sample solution text file provided in the repository.
